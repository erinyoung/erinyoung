# Greetings!

I work at the Utah Public Health Laboratory as a Bioinformatician.

I mostly work in the linux (centos and ubuntu) command line (shell).

I have written a few packages in python, but mostly I cobble bioinformatic tools together into nextflow workflows.

I'd like to learn rust, but haven't found the time. 

I'm almost always open for collaboration.
