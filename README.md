### Bioinformatician | Regional Technical Lead | Open Source Contributor

I am a **Senior Data Scientist and Technical Lead** specializing in high-throughput genomic data engineering. Currently, I serve as the Bioinformatics Regional Resource for the Mountain Region, architecting scalable, reproducible workflows for public health surveillance.

My work focuses on **workflow orchestration** (Nextflow), **containerization** (Docker/Singularity), and **cloud infrastructure** (AWS) to turn petabytes of raw sequencing data into actionable epidemiological insights.

### Technical Stack

* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scipy, PySAM), R, Groovy, Bash
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Nextflow (DSL2), Snakemake, WDL
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Singularity, AWS (Batch, S3, HealthOmics), GitHub Actions
* **Data Engineering:** ETL pipeline design, algorithmic benchmarking, metadata governance
